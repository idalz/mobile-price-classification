    ### About the project
    "project_title": "About the Project",
    "project_descr": """
    In the automotive market, determining the fair price of a car can be challenging for both buyers and sellers.
    Prices can vary significantly based on factors such as make, model, year, mileage, and additional features. 
    With such complexity, buyers often struggle to assess whether they are getting a good deal, while sellers may have difficulty setting competitive prices. 
    This lack of transparency can lead to frustration and uncertainty in the car-buying process. <br> <br>  

    Our <strong>main goal</strong> is to harness the power of PyTorch neural networks to develop a regression model capable of accurately <strong>predicting car prices</strong>. 
    By leveraging machine learning techniques and a comprehensive dataset, our objective is to create a tool that empowers both buyers and sellers with reliable price estimates.

    ### About the model
    "model_title": "About the Model",
    "model_descr": """
    Our model utilizes a simple <strong> neural network architecture implemented using PyTorch</strong>, trained on a comprehensive dataset from Kaggle.
    With input, hidden, and output layers, the model employs fully connected linear units and activation functions to capture intricate data patterns.
    Through iterative training using techniques like gradient descent, it minimizes prediction errors. During training, features are preprocessed, scaled, and encoded for optimal performance.
    Leveraging PyTorch's efficiency, the model iteratively learns from the data. 
    With a <strong>Mean Root Squared Error (MRSE) of 8145</strong>, our model showcases a good accuracy in predicting car prices, 
    underscoring its effectiveness in capturing the nuanced relationships between car features and prices.
